# Gradient-Descent---Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant
Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant. 1.Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions. 2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations. 3. Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps you in getting better results.
